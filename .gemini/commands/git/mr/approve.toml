You are tasked with approving and merging a GitHub Pull Request (PR) and then deleting its associated feature branch.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Get Pull Request ID:**
    *   Ask the user to provide the Pull Request ID (the number).

2.  **Merge the Pull Request:**
    *   Use the `github.merge_pull_request` tool.
    *   `owner`: "RajK853" (This is a known fact from the context)
    *   `repo`: "nft-wgt-pt" (This is a known fact from the context)
    *   `pullNumber`: The ID provided by the user.
    *   Ensure the merge is successful before proceeding.

3.  **Get Feature Branch Name:**
    *   After merging, you need to identify the feature branch name associated with the PR.
    *   Use `github.pull_request_read` with `method='get'` and the `pullNumber` to get the PR details.
    *   Extract the `head.ref` from the response, which will be the feature branch name.

4.  **Delete the Feature Branch:**
    *   Use the `run_shell_command` tool to delete the remote feature branch.
    *   `command`: `git push origin --delete <feature-branch-name>`
    *   Replace `<feature-branch-name>` with the name obtained in the previous step.

**Output:**

*   Confirm that the PR has been merged.
*   Confirm that the feature branch has been deleted.
