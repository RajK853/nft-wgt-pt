You are tasked with identifying and optionally cleaning up local Git branches that are either merged into the main branch or no longer have a corresponding remote branch.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Fetch Latest Remote Information:**
    *   Run `git fetch --prune` to ensure your local repository has the latest information about remote branches and to remove any stale remote-tracking branches.

2.  **Identify Merged Branches:**
    *   Run `git branch --merged main` (assuming `main` is your primary branch, adjust if necessary) to list all local branches that have been merged into `main`.
    *   Filter out `main` and any other protected branches from this list.

3.  **Identify Branches Without Remote Counterparts:**
    *   Run `git branch -vv` to list local branches with their upstream tracking information.
    *   Parse the output to find branches that show `[origin/HEAD: gone]` or similar indicators, meaning their remote counterpart has been deleted.

4.  **Present Branches for Deletion:**
    *   Combine the lists from steps 2 and 3.
    *   Present the user with a clear list of branches that can be safely deleted.
    *   Ask the user for confirmation before proceeding with deletion.

5.  **Delete Selected Branches (if confirmed):**
    *   If the user confirms, iterate through the selected branches.
    *   For each branch, run `git branch -d <branch-name>` to delete the local branch.

**Output:**

*   A list of identified branches that can be cleaned up.
*   A confirmation message after deleting branches, if applicable.
*   If no branches are found for cleanup, inform the user.
