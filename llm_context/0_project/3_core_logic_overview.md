The application's logic is built around the Next.js framework.

*   **Server Components**: Default in the `app` directory for server-side data fetching.
*   **Client Components**: Used for interactive UI. Marked with `"use client"`.
*   **Server Actions**: Asynchronous functions for server-side mutations.
*   **API Routes**: For building API endpoints.
*   **Supabase Client**: Located in `lib/supabase.ts` for backend interaction.
