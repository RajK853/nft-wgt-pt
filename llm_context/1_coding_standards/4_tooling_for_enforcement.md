# Tools for Enforcement

Several tools can help automate the enforcement of these coding standards:

*   **TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`):** Checks for type errors.
*   **ESLint:** Analyzes code for programmatic and stylistic errors.
*   **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter that automatically reformats code to comply with a consistent style.
*   **Husky and lint-staged:** Can be used to run linters and formatters on pre-commit hooks, ensuring that no bad code gets into the codebase.
