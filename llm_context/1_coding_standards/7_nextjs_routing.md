# Next.js Routing and Navigation

For internal navigation within the Next.js application, use the `<Link>` component from `next/link`.

## Reasoning:
- **Performance:** The `<Link>` component enables client-side navigation between routes, which is faster than the browser's default full-page reload. It also prefetches pages in the background for even faster navigation.
- **SEO:** Using `<Link>` ensures that the `href` is still available for search engine crawlers.
- **User Experience:** Client-side navigation provides a smoother, app-like experience for the user.

## Example:
Instead of:
```html
<a href="/about">About</a>
```

Use:
```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Link href="/about">
      <a>About</a>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

With the App Router, you don't need the `<a>` tag inside `<Link>`:
```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Link href="/about">
      About
    </Link>
  );
}
```
