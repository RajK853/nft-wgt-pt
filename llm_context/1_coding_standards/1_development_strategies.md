# Development Strategies

These are practical strategies to apply during the development process.

*   **Modularity:** The project is structured into modules and components with specific responsibilities. This separation of concerns should be maintained and extended.
*   **Readability:** Write clean, well-structured code. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and components, and follow consistent formatting.
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:** The application must be robust. It should anticipate potential failures (e.g., network issues, API errors) and handle them gracefully without crashing.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   **JSDoc:** All functions, classes, and methods should have JSDoc comments. These should explain the purpose, parameters, and return values.
    *   **Inline Comments:** Use inline comments sparingly for complex or non-obvious logic. Comments should explain *why* something is done, not *what* is done.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** The principle of writing tests alongside implementation is encouraged.
    *   **Unit Tests:** Each module or component should have unit tests to verify its behavior in isolation.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Never trust external data. Validate and sanitize all inputs.
    *   **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Never store sensitive information like API keys or credentials directly in the source code. Use environment variables.
